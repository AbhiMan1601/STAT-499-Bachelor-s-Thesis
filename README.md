## Predicting Healthcare Insurance Fraud Using Markov Observation Models

ABSTRACT : In 2011, A federal jury in Baltimore convicted cardiologist John R. McLean, of Salisbury, Maryland, on six health care fraud offences in connection with a scheme in which Dr. McLean submitted insurance claims for inserting unnecessary cardiac stents, ordered unnecessary tests, and made false entries in patient medical records, in order to defraud Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, raking in a whopping $711,583. Health care fraud cases like these have been on the rise for the past few years and the costs associated with fraud are passed on to the population in the form of increased premiums or serious harm to beneficiaries. There is an intense need for digital healthcare fraud detection systems to evolve in combating this societal threat. In this spirit, we introduce a novel statistical approach, developed by Professor Kouritzin at the University of Alberta, to model the simulated health insurance claims in a sequential set up using counting to capture fraudulent claims whenever they appear. It is a Hidden Markov Model which is expanded to allow for Markov chain observations called Markov Observation Model (MOM) that would estimate the most likely sequence of hidden states given the sequence of observations with high accuracy. The MOM has shown tremendous results when it comes to predicting outcomes and patterns, with an impressive 93\% accuracy in predicting coin flips, as compared to other methods which have had an accuracy between 60% to 85%.
